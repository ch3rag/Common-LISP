;CREATION OF WHERE (FROM SQL)

;THE PROBLEM WITH RIPPED ARGUMENT ==>

; Normally if a function is called with no argument for a particular keyword parameter, the parameter will have the value NIL.
; However, sometimes you'll want to be able to distinguish between a NIL that was explicitly passed as the argument to a keyword parameter and the default value NIL.
; To allow this, when you specify a keyword parameter you can replace the simple name with a list consisting of the name of the parameter, a default value, and another parameter name, called a supplied-p parameter.
; The supplied-p parameter will be set to true or false depending on whether an argument was actually passed for that keyword parameter in a particular call to the function.
; Here's a version of foo that uses this feature:

; (defun foo (&key a (b 20) (c 30 c-p)) (list a b c c-p))
; c-p will be set true or false based on whether c is passed or not as an argument
; b will be set to 20 and c will be set to 30 if no argument passed

; GENERALIZED SELECTOR
